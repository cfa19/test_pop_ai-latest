This is one of the most important parts of a coaching platform — and where you can truly differentiate from a career tool.

Values shouldn’t just be a text field. They should be:

* Structured enough to analyze
* Flexible enough to personalize
* Measurable enough to track alignment over time

Here’s how I’d design it.

---

# 1. Core Career Values Model

## A. Structured Value Dimensions (Recommended)

Create a predefined taxonomy of values users can rate.

Example core dimensions:

### 🌱 Growth & Mastery

* Personal growth
* Learning & skill development
* Intellectual challenge
* Mastery / expertise

### 💰 Security & Stability

* Financial security
* Predictable income
* Long-term stability
* Benefits & safety

### ⚖️ Lifestyle

* Work-life balance
* Flexibility
* Low stress
* Geographic freedom
* Time autonomy

### 🎨 Self-Expression

* Creativity
* Innovation
* Self-expression
* Building something original

### 🚀 Impact & Meaning

* Social impact
* Legacy
* Helping others
* Purpose-driven work

### 🧭 Autonomy & Control

* Independence
* Decision-making power
* Ownership
* Entrepreneurial freedom

### 🏆 Status & Recognition

* Prestige
* Title
* Influence
* Public recognition

## B. Rating System (Very Powerful)

For each value:

* Importance (1–10)
* Current Satisfaction (1–10)

This enables:

* Value alignment gap analysis
* Coaching diagnostics
* Misalignment detection
* Burnout prediction

Example insight:

> “Autonomy is 9/10 important, but satisfaction is 3/10.”

That’s coaching gold.

---

# 2. Ranking vs Rating (Better Together)

Offer:

* Top 5 core values (ranked)
* Full value ratings (1–10)

Ranking forces prioritization.
Rating allows nuanced analysis.

---

# 3. Dream Role Alignment Mapping

For each dreamed role, allow:

* Expected value fulfillment per dimension (1–10)
* Confidence in that assumption (1–10)

Now you can compare:

| Value              | Importance | Current | Dream Role Expected |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Autonomy           | 9          | 4       | 8                   |
| Financial Security | 8          | 7       | 5                   |

This enables structured decision-making conversations.

# 4. Advanced Coaching Layer

These fields add psychological depth:

* Values Conflict (e.g., Security vs Autonomy)
* Sacrifices Willing to Make
* Non-Negotiables
* Red Flags
* Identity-Level Value (“I am someone who…”)

---

# 5. Data Model Approach

Instead of storing values as static text in the role, create:

**ValueDimension**

* id
* name
* category

**UserValueProfile**

* user_id
* value_id
* importance_score
* satisfaction_score
* last_updated

**RoleValueAlignment**

* role_id
* value_id
* expected_score
* confidence_score

This allows:

* Evolution over time
* Comparison between roles
* Analytics & recommendations
* Personalized coaching prompts

---

# 6. MVP Version (If You Need Lean)

Start with:

* Select top 5 values
* Rate importance (1–10)
* Rate current satisfaction (1–10)
* Define 3 non-negotiables

That’s enough to drive powerful coaching sessions.

# Strategic Product Insight

Most career tools optimize for:

> Title + Salary

A coaching platform should optimize for:

> Alignment between Identity + Values + Lifestyle + Impact + Compensation

That’s what creates long-term satisfaction, not just career progression.

If you'd like, I can next help you design:

* A psychologically validated value framework
* A minimal but powerful UX flow
* Or a data schema ready for implementation
