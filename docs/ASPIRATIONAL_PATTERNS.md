# Aspirational Linguistic Patterns

## Overview

Aspirational messages can be categorized in two dimensions:

1. **Content Categories (WHAT)**: What the aspiration is about
   - Dream Roles, Salary Expectations, Life Goals, Values, Impact & Legacy, Skill & Expertise

2. **Linguistic Patterns (HOW)**: How the aspiration is expressed
   - Explicit Desire, Future-Oriented, Intentional Change, Identity Projection, Regret-Based, Conditional/Hypothetical

This document focuses on the **6 linguistic patterns** that classify the psychological and grammatical structure of aspirational statements.

## The 6 Linguistic Patterns

### 1. Explicit Desire

**Definition:** Direct, unambiguous statements of wanting or desiring something.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses desire verbs: want, wish, desire, hope, aspire
- Present tense expression of aspiration
- Clear and direct intent
- No conditional or uncertainty

**Commitment Level:** 4/5 (High - clear intent but may lack concrete action)

**Example Patterns:**
- "I want to [become a data scientist]"
- "I wish to [lead a team of engineers]"
- "I hope to [work at a FAANG company]"
- "My goal is to [double my current salary]"
- "I aspire to [make a real impact in healthcare]"

**Usage in Training Data:** 25% (Most common pattern)

**Psychological Profile:**
- Clear about desires
- Decisive language
- Strong motivation
- May or may not have action plan

---

### 2. Future-Oriented

**Definition:** Aspirations framed as future possibilities or expectations.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses future tense or temporal markers
- Implies progression or timeline
- Less immediate urgency than explicit desire
- Often includes time references

## Coaching Response Strategies

### For Intentional Change
**Strategy:** Tactical support, resource recommendations, accountability

**Response Template:**
```
"It's great that you're actively working towards [goal]! Here's what I recommend:
1. [Specific tactical step]
2. [Resource or connection]
3. [Accountability check-in]"
```

---

### For Explicit Desire
**Strategy:** Action planning, goal decomposition

**Response Template:**
```
"Your goal to [aspiration] is clear. Let's break it down:
1. What skills do you need?
2. What steps can you take this week/month?
3. Who can support you?"
```

---

### For Future-Oriented
**Strategy:** Timeline clarification, milestone setting

**Response Template:**
```
"'Someday' can become 'today' with the right plan. Let's make it concrete:
- When ideally would you like to achieve this?
- What would need to happen first?
- What's one step you could take this month?"
```

---

### For Identity Projection
**Strategy:** Vision-to-action bridge, identity affirmation

**Response Template:**
```
"I love that you can visualize yourself as [identity]. Let's make it real:
- What does a [identity] do daily?
- Which of those activities could you start now?
- How can you practice this identity today?"
```

---

### For Regret-Based
**Strategy:** Empathy, reframing, forward focus

**Response Template:**
```
"I hear the weight of that choice. While we can't change the past, we can shape the future.
- What about [missed opportunity] appeals to you now?
- How could you incorporate that into your current path?
- What's one step toward that interest you could take today?"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use empathetic tone, validate feelings, then redirect.

---

### For Conditional/Hypothetical
**Strategy:** Clarify dependencies, build confidence, create plans

**Response Template:**
```
"Let's explore that possibility together:
- What conditions need to be met?
- Which of these are within your control?
- What could you do to increase the likelihood of [condition]?
- What's a low-risk way to test this direction?"
```

## Training Data Distribution

### Recommended Sample Distribution

```
Explicit Desire       ████████████████████████░ 25%
Future-Oriented       ████████████████████░░░░░ 20%
Intentional Change    ████████████████████░░░░░ 20%
Identity Projection   ███████████████░░░░░░░░░░ 15%
Conditional           ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 12%
Regret-Based          ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  8%
```

**Rationale:**
- **Explicit Desire** is most common in real conversations
- **Intentional Change** and **Future-Oriented** are equally important
- **Identity Projection** is less common but valuable
- **Conditional** represents cautious explorers
- **Regret-Based** is least common and emotionally sensitive

## Usage in Training

### Generating Training Data

**Basic command:**
```bash
python training/scripts/generate_aspirational_data_with_patterns.py \
  --total-messages 1000 \
  --aspirations-per-category 50 \
  --output training/data/aspirational_with_patterns.csv
```

**Custom distribution:**
```bash
python training/scripts/generate_aspirational_data_with_patterns.py \
  --samples-per-pattern '{"explicit_desire": 300, "intentional_change": 250, ...}'
```

### Output Format

CSV with 5 columns:
- `message`: The generated message
- `category`: Always "aspirational"
- `content_category`: WHAT (dream_roles, salary, life_goals, etc.)
- `linguistic_pattern`: HOW (explicit_desire, future_oriented, etc.)
- `commitment_level`: Psychological commitment score (1-5, where 5=highest)

**Example rows:**
```csv
message,category,content_category,linguistic_pattern,commitment_level
"I want to become a data scientist",aspirational,dream_roles,explicit_desire,4
"Someday I'll run my own company",aspirational,dream_roles,future_oriented,3
"I'm planning to switch into design",aspirational,dream_roles,intentional_change,5
"I wish I had studied CS",aspirational,dream_roles,regret_based,1
"Maybe I'll try consulting",aspirational,dream_roles,conditional_hypothetical,2
```

## Pattern Detection in Production

### Heuristic Detection

Simple keyword-based detection for analytics:

```python
def detect_pattern(message: str) -> str:
    """Detect linguistic pattern using simple heuristics."""
    msg = message.lower()

    # Intentional change (highest priority - most specific)
    if any(p in msg for p in ["i'm planning", "i'm working towards", "i'm preparing"]):
        return "intentional_change"

    # Regret-based
    if any(p in msg for p in ["i wish i had", "i should have", "i regret"]):
        return "regret_based"

    # Identity projection
    if any(p in msg for p in ["i see myself", "i imagine myself", "i envision"]):
        return "identity_projection"

    # Conditional
    if any(w in msg for w in ["if ", "might", "could", "maybe"]):
        return "conditional_hypothetical"

    # Future-oriented
    if any(w in msg for w in ["someday", "one day", "eventually", "i'll"]):
        return "future_oriented"

    # Explicit desire (default/fallback)
    return "explicit_desire"
```

## Best Practices

### For Training Data Generation

1. **Balance distribution** according to recommended percentages
2. **Vary formality** within each pattern (formal ↔ casual)
3. **Mix tenses** where appropriate (present, future, past)
4. **Include temporal markers** (timeframes, deadlines)
5. **Test pattern coverage** with validation function

### For Model Training

1. **Use both dimensions** (content + linguistic) as features
2. **Weight intentional change** higher in loss function (more important to detect)
3. **Add extra validation** examples for regret-based (to avoid misclassification)
4. **Monitor confusion** between similar patterns (explicit vs. future-oriented)

### For Production Use

1. **Log detected patterns** for analytics
2. **A/B test responses** by pattern type
3. **Track conversion** from low-commitment → high-commitment patterns
4. **Special handling** for regret-based messages (empathy mode)

1. **Intensity Levels** - Weak/Medium/Strong for each pattern
2. **Hybrid Patterns** - Detect messages with multiple patterns
3. **Cultural Variations** - Pattern frequency varies by culture
4. **Emotion Detection** - Combine with emotional tone analysis
